# Hey there!
I’m Will. I spent most days writing JavaScript. I live in sunny Denver with my chocolate lab, Romeo. I work as a staff SWE for Openpath Security and love my job (please don’t send me recruiting emails). I'm passionate about helping self-taught engineers break into the industry- if there's anything I can do to help you in your journey, please don't hesitate to reach out.
